First (and maybe only) release in the next unstable series
- backported patches/fixes from stable branch
- added multi session import in data project view
- use libdvdcss to copy protected DVDs
- updated libburn support to 0.3.4
- new small SCSI library for a better device detection that will hopefully lead us to drop nautilus-cd-burner
- small GUI improvements
- new icons (thanks to Josef Vyb√≠ra and Kalle Person)
- lots of fixes

Thanks to all the people who contributed to this release through patches, translation, advice, artwork, bug reports.
